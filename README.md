 HELLO EVERYONE!
 I'm RASIDUL HOQUE,a BCA student. I'm a computer enthusiast and currently dealing with "Python" and "c" programming languages.
 Though, my favourite language for maintainability is 'PYTHON' because of its simple,clean syntax,object excapsulation and good liabrary support but with a greate enthusiasm i       would love to ecquire other languages as well.
 Beisdes coding,i love to listen to music and gamming. Unlike other programmers,here i m to feel the joy of coading  to express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code.
                              
                                 HOPING TO GET YOUR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT
